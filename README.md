Web based NMR spectra viewer.

# Installation
Download all files/folders into one location.

# Usage
Open index.html in your browser. This program utilizes WebWorker and WebAssemble, which can't be loaded automatically when runs locally unless you add required command line to Google Chrome. To do so, right click on the Google Chrome icon, select "Properties", and add "--allow-file-access-from-files" to the end of the "Target" field to be like this: "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files then click "Apply" or "OK". After this, click the Google Chrome icon to run the browser first before loading. Unfortunately, it poses a security risk by adding this option. Therefore, do NOT load any local files unless you are sure they are safe.
